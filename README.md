# 2D & 3D Shape Calculator using Java

## 📌 Project Description
This is a menu-driven Java console application that allows users to select
2D or 3D shapes and calculate their properties such as area, perimeter,
surface area, and volume. The project is built using Core Java and
demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## 🚀 Features
- Menu-driven console-based application
- Supports multiple 2D shapes (Circle, Rectangle, etc.)
- Supports multiple 3D shapes (Sphere, Cylinder, etc.)
- Calculates area and perimeter for 2D shapes
- Calculates surface area, curved surface area and volume for 3D shapes
- Uses method overriding and runtime polymorphism
- Clean and modular class structure
